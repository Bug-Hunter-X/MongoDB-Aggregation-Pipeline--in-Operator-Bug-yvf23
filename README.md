# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline $in Operator Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The incorrect usage can lead to unexpected results or failures.

## Problem
The original code uses the `$in` operator incorrectly in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline. This could lead to unexpected filtering behavior, especially when dealing with complex data types within the array used for the `$in` operator. 

## Solution
The corrected code shows the proper way to use the `$in` operator, ensuring accurate filtering results.  This version is more robust and provides accurate filtering of documents.

## How to reproduce
1. Set up a MongoDB instance.
2. Create a sample collection with the relevant data structures.
3. Run the code in `bug.js` to observe the incorrect behavior.
4. Run the code in `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
